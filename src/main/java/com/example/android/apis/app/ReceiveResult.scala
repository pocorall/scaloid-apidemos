/**
 * Shows how an activity can send data to its launching activity when done.y.
 * <p>This can be used, for example, to implement a dialog alowing the user to
 pick an e-mail address or image -- the picking activity sends the selected
 data back to the originating activity when done.</p>

 <p>The example here is composed of two activities: ReceiveResult launches
 the picking activity and receives its results; SendResult allows the user
 to pick something and sends the selection back to its caller.  Implementing
 this functionality involves the
 {@link android.app.Activity#setResult setResult()} method for sending a
 result and
 {@link android.app.Activity#onActivityResult onActivityResult()} to
 receive it.</p>
